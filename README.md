PERFORMANCE NOTES

Beach Spring
"Lord, Whose Love Through Humble Service"
"Praise the One Who Breaks the Darkness"

Of the two texts in LSB that appear with this tune, this piece was written with the latter one in mind. The texture of the A section is like a fanfare, but the registration is softer and more evocative of a dance, more rustic and less formal. The cornet melody is especially imitative of a bagpipe. Any bright solo with a cornet or a partial reed such as a Krummhorn or an Oboe will do. Take care not to play this prelude too slowly.

Besançon
"Scatter the Darkness, Break the Gloom"

The tune is treated in a particularly gentle and introspective way. The accompaniment voice in this trio is very pianistic and requires a careful touch. The sempre non legato should be observed strictly. The contrasting solo should be light and bright so that the low 8' fundamental does not muddy the texture. Take care not to play this prelude too quickly.

Bryn Calfaria
"Lord, Enthroned in Heavenly Splendor"
"Look, Ye Saints, the Sight is Glorious"

A grand ritornello introduces and concludes this prelude, which builds gradually through two statements of the chorale. The 4' flute accompaniment to the first statement may be played on an 8' flute an octave higher if desired.

Ein Feste Burg
"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God"

Feel free to pull out all the stops for this grand overture. Triple meter is employed on this prelude, giving this familiar tune a fresh, royal character. A well-registered echo on the second manual should be light, bright, and as soft as possible, like flutes 8,', 4', and 2', or 8', 4', and a small mixture with a closed swell box.

Greensleeves
"What Child is This?"

This prelude might appear at first to have the character of a crude peasant dance, but a more measured, introspective performance secures it better to the text, hence the exact tempo marking. The folkish character is employed to draw on themes not of mystery and wonder but of remembrance, of rustic storybook familiarity. The text that accompanies this tune is magnificent in its simplicity. Ideally, the cornet should be on separate stops, and decrescendo at the end by means of their gradual removal, but the decrescendo may be accomplished by whatever means are available. Take care to not linger too long on the quarter notes in the pedal.

Kingsfold
"No Tramp of Soldiers' Marching Feet"

This is a straightforward ritornello and chorale that is uniformly grand and pompous, fitting of the triumph we as Christians anticipate at the coming reign of Christ. The prelude is rather flexible in tempo, which should be decided in accordance with the needs of the organ and the room it is in.

Llangloffan
"The Night Will Soon Be Ending"
"The Clouds of Judgment Gather"

This is a subdued, contemplative setting of this tune with many melody notes elongated. A plain parallel fifth ostinato in the pedal gives way to gentle counterpoint in upper voices, which bloom fully in the second statement of the tune, which is a four-part chorale. A legato touch and a careful eye for phrasing best fit this prelude. If strings are available for the second manual, they may be used.

Martyrdom
"Alas! and Did My Savior Bleed"

This is a gentle ritornello and chorale in the Baroque style that is highly pastoral in nature, with lots of parallel thirds and comforting harmonic motion. The trills in the cantus firmus should be relaxed, never rushed or anxious, played by gently accelerating into and decelerating out of the motion. The upper voice in the ritornello is tuneful in its own right, and attention should be paid to its contours as well as the cadences.

Nettleton
"Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing"

This prelude contains two statements of this familiar American tune. The first is a trio that builds on the sequences in the introduction. The second statement begins with an ostinato in similar rhythm over a pedal tone, then returns to the character of the first statement in the third and fourth phrase. The gently lilting perpetual motion is best expressed by a slight non legato touch as per the needs of the organ and the room it is in, as well as light phrasing measure by measure in the manner a woodwind player would. No registration is given for the solo; anything firm enough to not be buried by the accompanying voices shall suffice.

Slane
"Lord of All Hopefulness"
"Christ Be My Leader"

A faithful Baroque pastorale by most metrics. The appearance of the hymn tune has little effect on the ritornello or harmonic motion that surround it, giving it a sense of peace befitting both these texts equally. In strict observance of the Largo, this prelude should be played no faster than the tempo marking given, and may be played a touch slower if the room is live enough to permit it. This prelude should also be played with the standard Baroque non-legato touch as per the needs of the organ and the room it is in; a non-legato touch is useful to give life to the slow rhythms that will otherwise sound dreadfully mechanical.
